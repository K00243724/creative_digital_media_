            <h2>Creative Digital Media</h2>
        <p>A basic building block of society has been that of communication. We need to be able to project our thoughts, express our feelings, tell stories of us and our by-gone eras and especially in the early days of man when we needed to give warnings!!</p>
        <p>We think logically of modern days, surrounded by creative digital media that we are at the fore front, pinnacle of creation, that we are the bee’s knees!!! I would actually suggest that modern creative digital media might have us spoiled a bit. Filling our eyes and minds with glorious shapes and colours, through creative digital media using data visualisation we see the world in a very exciting way.</p>
        <p>But…..do consider!! How we see data from creative digital media, knowing what we know today. I know what creative is, I’ve seen digital at work and I interact everyday with media. I’ve grown up seeing these things progress and change and probably the only part of creative digital media that has become the newest part is the digital. But then again that is a matter of opinion.  Digital as we call it today being a state of electrical pulses as compared to analogue waves are basically 2 states of the same thing.</p>
        <p>Now that being probably a wide grasp, considering communication, through creative digital media and the understandings taken from it, one might ask how did our ancestors get their information. Well surprise surprise, we can go right back to Palaeolithic man. While maybe communicating in grunts and beatings with their nearest and dearest, there was those at the fringe who used creative digital media……………. of the time (of course). These fringe elements told their stories on the walls of the caves to the generations to follow, of the wild animals that roamed the areas beyond our comprehension. So, think if you will, another grasp, but their depictions on the walls of the caves were their form of creative digital media……. OK, I know, but just think about it…. The individual was creative, it was no still life but the story was understandable. The digital side….. well this really came down to how “svg” the drawing was (nobody was looking closely at pixels…..) and the clay, animal blood and scratches on the walls was the encompassing media of the day.</p>
        <p>Grasping that and moving swiftly along creative digital media moved on from the cave walls and took the form of clay tablets, papyrus, wood, slate and animal skins right up to the Chinese inventing paper which was a major step forward in the form of communication and modernisation. </p>
        <p>So, as with everything, it all evolves, creative digital media changed down through the centuries. From the caveman etch to the true digital bites and bytes tucked away in hard drives it all tells a story of what we were at, what we did and what we intend to do for the future. Maybe one could say with evolution of the media also came an evolution of the data. The visualisation of the data became more enhanced and in doing so makes the human more advanced.</p>
        <p>All kinds of questions may open from here but at the end of the day we still need to recognise that we are still just a step along the same path as our friend with a rock in a cave living on the fringe.  </p>
